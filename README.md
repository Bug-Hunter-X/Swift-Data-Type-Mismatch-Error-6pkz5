This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift: passing incorrect data types to a function.  The `calculateArea` function is designed to calculate the area of a rectangle, taking two Double values as input. However, an example shows how trying to pass String values instead causes a compile-time error. The solution provides a corrected version that handles potential type errors and shows how to perform input validation.
